# Bank Items API

This module provides server and client APIs for accessing and managing raw bank transaction data, grouped by month, similar to the card items API.

- All endpoints follow the same conventions as cardItems.
- All error handling returns status 200 with error fields.
- All types are defined in `types.ts`.
- See `server.ts` and `client.ts` for usage.
